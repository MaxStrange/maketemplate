# Makefile Template Project

This project is just a simple template for an embedded C Makefile. I find that I write this again and
again, and I can never remember how I did it last time, so I have to go hunting for examples and pulling
in what I liked from several different projects.

So I'm going to just put this one Makefile here, and I'll use it from now on.

It uses FreeRTOS as an example, which is licensed under MIT (like this project).

Some of this (most?) was stolen from [here](https://github.com/franzflasch/stm32f4_makefile_project_template/blob/master/Makefile).
